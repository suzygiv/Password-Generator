## Description

The Password Generator app is implemented by using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavsScript code. 

## About the project

### How Does The Password Generator App Work?

- The user must click the "generate a password" button to begin the process. In order to generate the button, I had to create a variable called "generateBtn" that links back to the html button - var generateBtn = document.querySelector("#generate");
- Once the user clicks the button, they will be presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria. In order to create these prompts, I first had to create various arrays and variables for each of the criteria.

- The prompts presented to the user are as seen below. These prompts were created in order to determine the criteria that the user wanted to include in their password.

- Once the user selects which criteria that they'd like to include within their password, the JavaScript code will go through many "if" statements to ensure the criteria is met within their password.

- After the 'If' statements, the code will go through a 'for loop' which will spit out the desired password chosen by the user based on the criteria above.
